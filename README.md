# bca-npm-template
This is designed to serve as a starter project for developing npm packages.

## Getting Started
Create a new repository by selecting "Use this template" from the Code page  then: 
* renaming the workspace file to match the new repo name,
* updating the package and repository name in package.json,
* updating index.js with the names of all objects provided by your package, and
* running npm install locally and check-in the generated package-lock and update package.json.
Make sure to create a repository secret named NODE_AUTH_TOKEN with the value of a
Personal Access Token with write (and hence read) access to the account packages.
